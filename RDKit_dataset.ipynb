    "# Using RDKit to Build a Dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a file called `amino_acids.txt` in the `data` folder that contains SMILES for the 20 naturally occurring amino acids.  Your task is to combine all the skills we have learned so far in our class to build a dataset for molecules and write a file. Your goal is to create a comma-separated value file with columns `SMILES`, `num_heavy` (number of heavy atoms), `molecular_weight`, and one other molecular descriptor of your choice for the molecules in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read SMILES from a text file.\n",
    "2. Make an RDKit molecule for each SMILES.  Note that if you print the list of smiles strings after you read them in from the file, they will each have a newline character (`\\n`) at the end of each item.  This makes sense because each line was printed on a new line of the file, but you will need to delete those newline characters before you can make the RDKit molecule from each SMILES string.  You can do this using this syntax: `smiles_string = smiles_string.strip()`.\n",
    "3. Get the number of heavy atoms, molecular weight, and one other descriptor of your choice.\n",
    "4. Write a file with the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few lines of your file should look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SMILES,num_heavy,molecular_weight,tpsa\n",
    "C[C@H](N)C(=O)O,6,89.09399999999998,63.32000000000001\n",

    "```\n",
    "   \n",

    "Save your file as `amino_acids_processed.csv` and upload it to the Canvas assignment for this week.\n",
