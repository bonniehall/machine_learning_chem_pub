    "## Simplified Molecular-Input Line-entry System: SMILES \n",
    "\n",
    "SMILES stands for \"Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System\" and is a way to represent molecules as a string of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the molecule ethanol. The image below shows a representation that we are used to seeing in chemistry:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ethanol](images/ethanol.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the SMILES representation of this molecule would be \"CCO\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about SMILES at [this tutorial](https://archive.epa.gov/med/med_archive_03/web/html/smiles.html), but rules for atoms and bonds are also repeated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atoms\n",
    "SMILES supports all elements in the periodic table. An atom is represented using its respective atomic symbol. Upper case letters refer to non-aromatic atoms; lower case letters refer to aromatic atoms. If the atomic symbol has more than one letter the second letter must be lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonds\n",
    "```\n",
    "-\tSingle bond\n",
    "=\tDouble bond\n",
    "#\tTriple bond\n",
    "*\tAromatic bond\n",
    ".\tDisconnected structures\n",
    "```\n",
    "Single bonds are the default and therefore need not be entered. For example, 'CC' would mean that there is a non-aromatic carbon attached to another non-aromatic carbon by a single bond, and the computer would identify the structure as the chemical ethane. It is also assumed that the bond between two lower case atom symbols is aromatic. A blank terminates the SMILES string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "A branch from a chain is specified by placing the SMILES symbol(s) for the branch between parenthesis. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "CC(O)C\t2-Propanol\n",
    "CC(=O)C\t2-Propanone\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "A ring is specified by placing a number directly after the SMILES symbol where the ring closure occurs. This number acts as a marker, indicating that the atoms with the same number are connected, thus forming a ring. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C1CCCC1 cyclopentane\n",
    "n1ccccc1\tPyridine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMILES Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/smiles_example_1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-height:300px;\">\n",

    "  <img src=\"images/smiles_example_2.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-height:300px;\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Online Resources\n",
    "Most of the time, you will not need to write a SMILES string by hand. You will be able to look up a molecule's SMILES string from a web database like [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use tools like this [molecule sketcher from the Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/chemical-sketch)\n",
    "to draw molecules and get their SMILES strings."

    "## Part 2: The RDKit Library\n",
    "\n",
    "There are Python libraries that are made for working just with chemical data. One commonly used library in Python for data science (or cheminformatics) is called [RDKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDKit). RDKit is an open-source cheminformatics library, primarily developed in C++ and has been under development since the year 2000. We will be using the Python interface to RDKit, though there are interfaces in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDKit provides a molecule object that allows you to manipulate chemical structures. It has capabilities for reading and writing molecular file formats, calculating molecular properties, and performing substructure searches. In addition, it offers a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms such as molecular fingerprint generation, similarity metrics calculation, and molecular descriptor computation. This notebook introduces RDKit basics, but we will see more of all of these topics in later notebooks.\n",

    "Most of this functionality is achieved through the RDKit `mol` object. In Python, we use the word \"object\" to refer to a variable type with associated data and methods. \n",
    "One example of an object we have seen in notebooks is a list - we could also call it a \"list object\". An object has `attributes` (data) and `methods`. \n",
