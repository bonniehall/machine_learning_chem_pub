    "To analyze data from a file, we need to read that data into our code.  We will need to specify where the file is located that should be read into the code.  This is the concept of a file path.  You can think of a file path as the series of folders you would click on to get to the file if you were navigating your computer's file structure.  In this class, all of our data files are in a folder called `data` which is in the GitHub repo you cloned for class.  \n",
