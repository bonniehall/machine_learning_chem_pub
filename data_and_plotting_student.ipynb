    "# Part 1: Working with Tabular Data using numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used python library for working so-called tabular data (data presented in rows and columns) is numerical python or numpy.  As with any python library, we begin by importing the library so we can use its function in our code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with our lesson last week, the first step of our process will be to read in our data from an external file.  As we already discussed, there are many ways to read in data from files in python. In a previous lesson, we used the `readlines()` function to read in a complex output file. In theory, you could always use the `readlines()` function, and then use the data parsing tools we learned previously to format the data as you needed. But sometimes there are other ways that make more sense, particularly if the data is (1) all or mostly one type of data (for example, all numbers) and/or (2) formatted in a table. Frequently, a table will be mostly numbers, but have column or row labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common file format for such tables is the CSV file or comma separated values. This is exactly what it sounds like. Data is presented in rows, with each value separated by a comma. If you have data in a spreadsheet program that you need to import into a python code, you can save the data as a csv file to read it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a CSV file that contains data from a molecular dynamics trajectory. We have a 20 ns simulation that used a 2 fs timestep. The data was saved to the trajectory file every 1000 steps, so our file has 10,000 timesteps. At each timestep, we are interested in the distance between particular atoms. These trajectories were generated with the AMBER molecular dynamics program and the distances were measured with the python program MDAnalysis. The table of atomic distances was saved as a CVS file called “distance_data_headers.csv”. This file is in your `data` folder that you cloned from GitHub.  You could open the file in a text editor and study it to determine its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data is uniform in structure and presented in a table, there is a better way to read it in than using `readlines`.  We will use a function from numpy called `genfromtxt` to read in the data.  The output of this function is a data structure called a numpy array, where the data is stored in rows and columns.  "
